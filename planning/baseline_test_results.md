# Baseline Test Results - Pre-Implementation

**Date:** 2025-10-03
**Purpose:** Establish baseline behavior before local model implementation
**Code Version:** Current `rag_assessment_partial.py` (OpenAI only)

---

## Test Environment

- **Python:** Python 3.x
- **OpenAI API:** Active with valid API key
- **Model Configuration:**
  - Embedding: `text-embedding-ada-002` (from .env)
  - LLM: `gpt-3.5-turbo` (from .env)
- **FAQ Corpus:** 3 files (faq_auth.md, faq_employee.md, faq_sso.md)
- **Total Chunks:** 5 chunks (200 chars each)

---

## Test Results

### Test 1: PTO Policy Query

**Query:** "What is the PTO policy?"

**Output:**
```json
{
  "answer": "The PTO policy at TechFlow Solutions offers unlimited PTO with a minimum requirement of 15 days per year, as stated in faq_employee.md. Employees must get approval for time off exceeding 2 consecutive weeks and PTO requests require a 2-week notice except for emergencies.",
  "sources": [
    "faq_employee.md",
    "faq_sso.md"
  ]
}
```

**Validation:**
- ✅ Valid JSON format
- ✅ Contains "answer" field
- ✅ Contains "sources" array
- ✅ Cites at least 2 sources (2 sources)
- ✅ Answer references source files correctly
- ✅ Factually accurate (based on faq_employee.md)

**Performance:**
- Embedding: ~1.4 seconds (5 chunks)
- Query + Generation: ~3-4 seconds
- Total: ~5 seconds

### Test 2: Password Reset Query

**Query:** "How do I reset my password?"

**Output:**
```json
{
  "answer": "To reset your password, you can use the reset link on the login page as mentioned in faq_auth.md. Additionally, if you encounter any issues with resetting your password, you can refer to the SSO FAQ in faq_sso.md for assistance on enabling Single Sign-On for your account.",
  "sources": [
    "faq_auth.md",
    "faq_sso.md",
    "faq_employee.md"
  ]
}
```

**Validation:**
- ✅ Valid JSON format
- ✅ Contains "answer" field
- ✅ Contains "sources" array
- ✅ Cites at least 2 sources (3 sources)
- ✅ Answer references source files correctly
- ✅ Primary source (faq_auth.md) cited correctly

---

### Test 3: Equity Vesting Query

**Query:** "What is equity vesting?"

**Output:**
```json
{
  "answer": "Equity vesting refers to the process by which employees gradually gain ownership of their equity grants over a specified period of time. In TechFlow Solutions, new hires receive equity grants that vest over 5 years, with 10% vesting after the first year and 22.5% vesting each subsequent year (faq_employee.md). This means that employees gradually earn the right to their equity grants over time, incentivizing them to stay with the company and aligning their interests with the long-term success of the organization.",
  "sources": [
    "faq_employee.md",
    "faq_sso.md"
  ]
}
```

**Validation:**
- ✅ Valid JSON format
- ✅ Contains "answer" field
- ✅ Contains "sources" array
- ✅ Cites at least 2 sources (2 sources)
- ✅ Answer references source files correctly
- ✅ Factually accurate and detailed

## Current Behavior Observations

### Stdout/Stderr Output

**Current behavior:**
- **Stdout:** Contains both progress bars (tqdm) and JSON output
- **Input prompt:** "Enter your question: " appears in stdout
- **Progress bar:** tqdm embedding progress appears before JSON

**Example:**
```
Embedding: 100%|██████████| 5/5 [00:01<00:00,  3.60it/s]
Enter your question: {
  "answer": "...",
  "sources": [...]
}
```

**Issue:** Mixed output makes it difficult to parse JSON programmatically

**Note:** This is existing behavior, not a regression

---

## Configuration Testing

### Environment Variables

**Current .env configuration:**
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
EMBED_MODEL=text-embedding-ada-002
LLM_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo
```

**Behavior:**
- ✅ Reads `EMBED_MODEL` from environment (line 30)
- ✅ Reads `LLM_MODEL` from environment (line 31)
- ✅ Falls back to defaults if not set
- ✅ API key required (fails without it)

---

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

### Core Requirements (from GUIDE.pdf)

1. ✅ **Ingest FAQ documents** - 5 chunks from 3 files
2. ✅ **Accept natural language questions** - via CLI input
3. ✅ **Retrieve relevant content** - Top-K=4 with cosine similarity
4. ✅ **Generate answers** - Using GPT-3.5-turbo

### Technical Specifications

- ✅ Uses `text-embedding-ada-002` for embeddings
- ✅ Uses `gpt-3.5-turbo` for answer generation
- ✅ Cosine similarity for relevance scoring
- ✅ Chunk size: ~200 characters
- ✅ Retrieve TOP_K = 4 chunks
- ✅ **Answers cite at least 2 source files** (all tests)
- ✅ Output format: JSON with `answer` and `sources` fields

## Baseline Files Saved

**Test outputs saved to:**
- `/tmp/baseline_pto.json` - PTO policy query
- `/tmp/baseline_password.json` - Password reset query
- `/tmp/baseline_equity.json` - Equity vesting query

**Use these for post-implementation comparison:**
```bash
# After implementing local models, compare:
diff /tmp/baseline_pto.json /tmp/new_pto.json
```

---

## Success Criteria for Implementation

After implementing local model support, verify:

1. **Default OpenAI Mode Unchanged**
   - Same JSON output structure
   - Same source citations
   - Same accuracy
   - No new stdout pollution beyond existing tqdm

2. **New Local Model Mode Works**
   - Valid JSON output
   - At least 2 source citations
   - Comparable accuracy
   - Configurable via `USE_LOCAL_MODELS=true`

3. **No Breaking Changes**
   - Existing .env configuration still works
   - Same command-line interface
   - JSON parseable from stdout

---

## Known Issues (Pre-Implementation)

1. **tqdm progress bar on stdout** - existing issue, not blocking
2. **Input prompt on stdout** - existing issue, not blocking
3. **Mixed stdout output** - makes JSON parsing harder

**Note:** These are acceptable in current implementation. New implementation should improve by using stderr for informational messages.

---

## Conclusion

✅ **Current implementation working correctly**
- All acceptance criteria met
- JSON output valid
- Source citations working
- Environment configuration working

✅ **Ready to proceed with local model implementation**
- Baseline behavior documented
- Test cases saved for comparison
- Success criteria defined

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement Blueprint 0-6 from local_model_implementation_plan.md
2. Re-run these exact tests
3. Compare outputs to ensure no regressions
4. Test new local model mode
